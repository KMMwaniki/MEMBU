                Membu is a journey of love, tradition, and the belief that nature knows best. It all started with a deep
                connection to the land the lands of Meru and Embu, where my parents come from. These regions, with their
                rich history, lush landscapes, and vibrant communities, have always been a source of inspiration. The
                values of respect for nature and the importance of living in harmony with it were instilled in me from an
                early age.

                Growing up, I saw how my parents always valued what nature provided, how they trusted its gifts, from the
                food they ate to the way they cared for themselves. It was their belief that everything needed for health
                and well-being was already around us. This belief in nature's power, passed down through generations, is
                what sparked the idea behind Membu.

                protect your hair. Whether your hair is curly, coily, wavy, or straight, we believe that nature has the
